# Portfolio Optimization Using Machine Learning

Developed a hybrid ML framework for dynamic portfolio optimization using supervised learning, time series forecasting, and reinforcement learning.

## Key Features
- Created a custom OpenAI Gym environment to simulate multi-asset portfolio management
- Predicted asset returns using Random Forest and LSTM models
- Implemented Actor-Critic reinforcement learning to adjust portfolio weights dynamically
- Achieved improved Sharpe ratio (0.284) and better drawdown control compared to traditional strategies

## Tools Used
Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym, Matplotlib, NumPy

## Status
Project completed under academic mentorship as part of a research initiative.  
Paper submission to iCWiCOM 2025 is planned (under review for Springer publication).

## Future Work
- Add backtesting interface using Streamlit  
- Tune RL agent for real-time data input
